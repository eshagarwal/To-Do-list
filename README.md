# To-Do list

### Requirements for this To-Do list:

- As a user I want to be able to add new items to my To-Do list.
- As a user I want to be able to complete items of my To-Do list, while keeping them on the list.
- As a user I want to be able to delete items from my To-Do list.
- As a user I want to gain a quick overview what I should do next. Therefore, open tasks should be at the top of the list (oldest first) and completed tasks at the bottom of the list.
